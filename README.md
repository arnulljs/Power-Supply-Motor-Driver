# Power Supply + Motor Driver ‚Äì CpE 2303L Practical Activity

This repository contains the PCB project files for a **Power Supply and Motor Driver Module**, submitted as part of a practical activity in **CpE 2303L: Computer Engineering Drafting and Design**. The design integrates mechanical, electrical, and environmental considerations to ensure safe and reliable performance.

---

## üß© Features

- Combined **Power Supply** and **Motor Driver** on a single board
- **Heatsink integration** for TO-220 components
- **Current-rated track widths** based on component datasheets
- **Copper fill zones** for effective GND distribution
- Organized component layout for thermal and mechanical stability

---

## üìê Design Considerations

### Mechanical
- 4x mounting holes (3.2mm) for stable board installation
- Copper pours help with EMI reduction and heat spreading

### Electrical
- Track widths adjusted based on current ratings from datasheets
- DIP-16 sockets for motor driver ICs (e.g., L293D)
- Barrel jack for DC input

### Environmental
- Heatsink for thermal dissipation on TO-220 components
